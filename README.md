# Docker Test: build hooks

I want to learn which environment variables are available when using Build Hooks and how Build Hooks work in general

See Docker image on Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/tmaier/docker-test-build-hooks/>

I learned about the hooks feature of Docker Hub at <https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/508#issuecomment-240616319>

## Finding from [Build Details](https://hub.docker.com/r/tmaier/docker-test-build-hooks/builds/)
